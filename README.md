[Click here](http://gerardbosch.github.io/resume) to see the up to date PDF version.

ðŸ‘† The PDF is built and published on GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions :)

# How to build

To do a local build of the TEX you need a Texlive distribution with all the required packages (full-installation just
to be sure).
Then:

```
lualatex main.tex
```

That's it!
